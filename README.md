This addon allows you to use Blender with natural language commands using OpenAI's GPT-3.5/GPT-4


### ðŸ’¡ Code generations by the more powerful model, GPT-4 are remarkably higher quality than GPT-3.5. Unfortunately, the model is only available via the waitlist. This addon also has a Pro version that is powered by GPT-4 and does not require you to have an OpenAI account. Available for purchase for a one-time charge of $29.99: https://gd3kr.gumroad.com/l/blendergptpro
